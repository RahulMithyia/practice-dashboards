# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard

## 📁 Overview
This project focuses on developing an **HR Analytics Dashboard** to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights from HR data. We began by exporting tabular data from **Power BI’s data view** into an **Excel spreadsheet**. Using **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**, we analyzed various relationships between columns to understand workforce trends and performance metrics.

## 🛠️ Process & Methodology

### 1. Data Extraction
- Exported the dataset from Power BI's Table view into Excel for flexible manipulation.

### 2. Data Analysis using Pivot Tables
- Created dynamic Pivot Tables to explore relationships between variables such as:
  - Department vs. Attrition Rate  
  - Job Role vs. Satisfaction Level  
  - Age vs. Monthly Income  
  - Education vs. Performance Rating  
- Calculated and tracked important KPIs like:
  - Average Monthly Income  
  - Employee Attrition  
  - Job Satisfaction Levels  
  - Training Hours Completed  

### 3. Data Visualization
- Used Pivot Charts to visually represent patterns, making insights more accessible.
- Experimented with different chart types (bar, column, pie, line) to find the most effective visuals for storytelling.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified high-attrition departments and job roles.
- Analyzed trends in income distribution, satisfaction, and performance.
- Recognized patterns in work-life balance and training investments.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Integrate visuals back into **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.
- Apply filters/slicers for deeper drill-down analysis.
- Consider importing additional HR datasets (e.g., employee feedback, exit interviews) for enhanced insights.
