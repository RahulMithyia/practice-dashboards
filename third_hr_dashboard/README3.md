# üìä HR Analytics Dashboard

## üìÅ Overview
This project focuses on developing an **HR Analytics Dashboard** to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights from HR data. We began by exporting tabular data from **Power BI‚Äôs data view** into an **Excel spreadsheet**. Using **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**, we analyzed various relationships between columns to understand workforce trends and performance metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Process & Methodology

### 1. Data Extraction
- Exported the dataset from Power BI's Table view into Excel for flexible manipulation.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Basic cleanup was performed in Excel.
- Further data transformation can be done using the **Transform Data** option (in Power BI's **Home** tab), where:
  - **Duplicate rows** can be removed  
  - **Null values** can be handled  
  - **Spelling errors** and **inconsistent formatting** can be corrected easily

### 3. Data Analysis using Pivot Tables
- Created dynamic Pivot Tables to explore relationships between variables such as:
  - Department vs. Attrition Rate  
  - Job Role vs. Satisfaction Level  
  - Age vs. Monthly Income  
  - Education vs. Performance Rating  
- Calculated and tracked important KPIs like:
  - Average Monthly Income  
  - Employee Attrition  
  - Job Satisfaction Levels  
  - Training Hours Completed  

### 4. Data Visualization
- After loading and cleaning the data, we created visuals that best explain the overall situation and uncover key insights.
- Used Pivot Charts and Power BI visuals to represent patterns in the data.
- Experimented with different chart types (bar, column, pie, line) to enhance interpretability.

## üîç Key Insights
- Identified high-attrition departments and job roles.
- Analyzed trends in income distribution, satisfaction, and performance.
- Recognized patterns in work-life balance and training investments.

---

## üìå Next Steps
- Integrate visuals back into **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.
- Apply filters/slicers for deeper drill-down analysis.
- Consider importing additional HR datasets (e.g., employee feedback, exit interviews) for enhanced insights.
